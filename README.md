# justiva-script

About
-------

This program is designed to buy applications on the website justiva.ru.


How it works
-------

The program uses a parser to check if there are any new applications, and if there are, it buys them. Pretty simple, right?


Technologies used
-------
http requests (POST, GET), html parsing (beatifulsup)


Navigation
-------

-- testPARS.py - the main file, where work is done on sending requests, pulling data, and subsequent actions.

-- regexp.py - contains a list of cities that should be included in applications.
